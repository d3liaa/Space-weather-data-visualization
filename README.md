# Space weather data visualization project
## **Data Visualization & Exploration - Final Assignment**  

This repository showcases my final assignment for the university course **"Data Visualization & Exploration"** at UniBZ. The project explores the **Sun as the primary driver of space weather**, with a particular focus on **sunspots and solar flares**.  

### **Data Sources**  
The datasets used in this project include:  
- **Sunspot Data from SILSO** – Daily sunspot count.  
- **NOAA GOES-R 18 Satellite Data:**  
  - **XRS Flare Summary** – Contains flare energy levels (XRSB flux, background flux, and integrated flux) along with flare classifications.  
  - **XRS Flare Location** – Provides the locations of solar flares on the Sun’s surface.  

### **Project Overview**  
The project begins with **data loading and cleaning**, followed by an in-depth focus on **data visualization and exploration**. The key areas of study include:  
- **Flare intensity over time.**  
- **Flare count and distribution across different classes and time periods.**  
- **Flare locations, density distributions, and class-based location patterns.**  
- **Sunspots and their relationship with solar flares and solar cycles.**  

By leveraging visual analysis, this project aims to provide insights into the patterns and behavior of solar activity.

The project was entirely made in Rstudio.
